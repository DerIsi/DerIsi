### 👋 Hi there, I'm Ismail or in short Isi! 🚀

As the **Lead Cloud Architect** at Mercedes Benz Leasing Deutschland, I specialize in designing and managing cloud solutions, with Kubernetes as our main computing resource. ☁️🔧
My tech journey began with **Java backend** and CLI development, but the allure of cloud technologies led me towards a new path. 

Today, I wield the power of **automation**, specifically **Terraform**, to build, orchestrate, and maintain complex cloud infrastructures on **Azure**. 
To keep our Kubernetes cluster humming, I use **GitOps** tools like **flux.cd**. And when it comes to conceptualizing intricate solutions, **draw.io** is my faithful ally. 💻

Away from the codes and clouds, I enjoy a good workout at the gym — because a keen mind is best complemented with a fit body. 💪🏋️‍♂️

Catch me at the upcoming **WeAreDeveloper Conference** in Berlin, where I'll be sharing insights on setting up a Kubernetes infrastructure swiftly and efficiently. Looking forward to connecting with you all! 👨‍💻🌐
